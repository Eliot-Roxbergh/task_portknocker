# Version 0.1

Support basic client and server functionality;
    0) Server listens to UDP/53
    1) Client sends a hardcoded secret directly to server via UDP
    2) If secret is correct,
        -- server adds client to list of whitelisted IPs
        -- else both client and server quits with error code.
    3) Server now opens a TLS/443 socket instead, and instead of matching on a secret
        the server now only allows the specific IP whitelisted in prior step
    4) The client connects, and if the source IP matches the whitelist,
        -- some messages are exchanged over this secure channel.
        -- else both client and server quits with error code.
    5) Server and client terminates

Support tooling;
    make codechecker) to run static analysis
    make clangformat) to run linter to automatically format the source code
    make test) to run basic unit test suite as well as memcheck
    make coverage) to check codecoverage of the unit tests


Test results:
    GCC         OK   (a warning in test/unit_test.cc)
    Codechecker OK
    Valgrind    OK
    lcov        OK   (Code coverage for the unit tests are 78.7% in src/ and 0% in tool/)
